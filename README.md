# Beam Shutter

Set of shutters for controlling beams in optical systems. Designed for fluorescence microscopy to prevent photobleaching.

## Getting Started

When you have servos with any light blocking material attached to them simply connect them to any Arduino board, attach some switches, upload code to Arduino (change ports in code according to your setup) and enjoy.

## Built With

* [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/) - Arduino web site
* [Thingiverse - shutters](https://maven.apache.org/) - 3D models of shutters and holders for servos
